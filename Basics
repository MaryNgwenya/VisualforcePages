//Visualforce Controllers provide a set of instructions for what to do when a user interacts with the page. There are several different types of controllers.

//Standard Controllers - use the default functionality provided by salesforce for working with a single record
//Standard List Controllers - use the default functionality provided by salesforce for working with a lists of records
//Custom Controllers - allows developers to use Apex to create their own functionality for a Visualforce page
//Custom Controller Extensions - allows developers to have a custom controller that inherits some of the functionality from another controller, standard or custom
//It's important to note that when talking about controllers, Salesforce provides a standard controller for every object - even custom ones. Custom controllers are not just for custom objects. They're used when you need to implement extra functionality that is not present in a standard controller. 

<apex:page standardController="Account" >
    <h1>
        Hello from a heading one tag!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Hello from a paragraph tag!
    </p>
